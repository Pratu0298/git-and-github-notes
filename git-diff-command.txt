All about git diff command 

How it works ?

1) git diff filename.extension - to check the modification for a file
2) git diff - to check modification in all file
3) git reset filename.extension - make staged file to unstaged file
(the changes we have added using "git add ." command to remove it we use this)
4) git checkout filename.extension - to make the updation after reset in file 
from stage to unstage

Note : after git reset command you have to use the git checkout command
then only files will be updated 

5) git checkout . - to reset all files in a folder
(eka folder madhil sarv files na reset karnyasathi)
